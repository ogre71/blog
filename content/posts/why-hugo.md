I don't take notes with OneNote. I take notes in markdown, and use Hugo to render the markdown.

If I were to take notes with OneNote, I become dependent on OneNote, and am constrained to use one Note to share them. 

But... if I plop them down into Hugo, I'm not done. I'm just beginning. 

1) Hugo is a valuable skill. I've learned something. 
2) Information in Hugo is easily shared. My notes, thoughts, plans, whatever, are more easily shared. I can link to them with hyperlinks and show easily share my data this way. 
3) It becomes a coding dojo where I can hone my skills and, contrarty to my self minimizing nature, showcase them. Some of the skills follow: 
    * Markdown. 
    * Mermaid.
    * Embedding javascript. 
    * Git and GitHub fun 
6) My brain is less smooth at the end of the day. 
7) It forces me to come closer to coming out of my shell. 

Drawbacks: 
1) Fatigure. One gets tired. Rather than mindlessly dumping into OneNote, the Hugo way of note-taking, is actually taxing. It is one more thing in a giant stack of information that I must manage.
